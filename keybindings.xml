<!--
  This a section of the openbox config where the keybindings are set.
  You may have noticed that these keybindings recreate those used common
  in window managers like XMonad and suckless's dwm.
  This is because dwm and xmonad are my favourite window managers and I
  hope that anyone using this openbox setup may gain some familiarity
  with dwm and xmonad without having to use them right away. Once one is
  comfortable in this environment, I believe that it may be beneficial for
  them to eventually migrate to dwm or xmonad due to their minimalism
  and their customizability.
